# Setup

First, install all submodules, i.e. follow the readme of nullmq and hexameter. Be warned, the nullmq setup process is kinda buggy from my experience.

Then, you should be able to run bridge.py and tower.lua using a python or lua interpreter, respectively.

With these services running, you can open orpheus.html and connect to a running HADES server. You can use the rescue example of the Academia repository if you call CHARON on the world file and append the parameter --hadesparams:construction=1 .
